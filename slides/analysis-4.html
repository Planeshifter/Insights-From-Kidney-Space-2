<aside class="notes">
    For any given hypothesis, we limit our focus to the subset of relevant documents containing the
    synsets in question on which the hypothesis is based. Then, we draw a random sample of the documents,
    and for each observation in the sample we then generate a summary document to reduce burden placed
    on the human judge who in the last step reads the summaries and for each of them checks whether the hypothesis
    holds or not.

<aside class="notes">
    This situation has led to an increasing burden on the health-care system, making it a national issue:
    Looking at the numbers, we see that in the year 2009, more than 40 billion US dollars were spent on the treatment of End Stage Renal Disease,
    the final stage of CKD. 
    By the year 2014, costs have almost tripled compared to 1998.

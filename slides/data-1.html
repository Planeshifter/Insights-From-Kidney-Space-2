<aside class="notes">
    Specifically, we gathered data from two forums: Davita and the appropriately named KidneySpace from which I have stolen the idea for the title.
    Often, getting the data is a challenge, and this case was no exception:
    We had to write a custom scraping tool to download the posts from the forums, roughly 10,000 threads in total.
    Although DaVita boasts an impressive number of 180,000 registered users,
    only 5,603 are represented in our data set. Why? Because most of them are bystanders and only a minority is active.

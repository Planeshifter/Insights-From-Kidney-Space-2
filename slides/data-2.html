    Even worse, when we have a look at the active users, only a minority posts regulary, i.e. are heavy users.
    You can see this in this bar chart, where on the x-Axis we see the number of posts and on the y-Axis the number of users with that many posts.
    As we can see, a majority of users has only one or two posts, and only 0.2% of all registered users have more than 25 posts.
    Since this presents a possible threat to the external validity of our results, we tried to cancel out the
    influence of the heavy users by mostly focusing on the first post of any individual.

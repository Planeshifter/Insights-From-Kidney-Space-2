<aside class="notes">
    Today, I am going to share with you insights from kidney space.
    The title might give allusions to outer space, the final frontier, the non-plus-ultra of human curiosity.
    However, as philosopher Bruno Latour has noted, in the age of the anthropocene the direction is not plus-ultra anymore,
    but plus-intra, inward. Switching our perspective, we focus ourselves on the biggest riddle of all, the human being.

    Merging them together, we obtain a tree like this. Now we can
    focus our attention, for example if we are interested in fruits,
    we would find that the document contains one orange and one lemon.
    Such a synthesis would be impossible on the level of word token analysis.
    Obviously, this is a very simplified illustration. Imagine that we have ten-thousands
    of synsets spanning thousands of documents. Merging all these, we create a gigantic
    super-tree for our whole document collection, which works as a search engine
    for our corpus: Assume that we are interested in the types of disease symptoms people
    talk about. Since we also keep track of the word frequencies,
    we would find that 1195 people talk about unspecific pain, 195 about nausea, 174 about cramps
    and 109 about edemata.

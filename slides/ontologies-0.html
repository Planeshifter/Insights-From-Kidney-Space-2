<h2>Using an Ontology</h2>

<aside class="notes">
    These challenges force us to say goodbye to the word token as the atomic unit and instead say hello to semantics,
    that is to the meaning of the words. But if we understand words not as mere tokens,
    but as meaningful signifiers, we have to use ontological information.
    When we have a look at this semantic space, we see that words are connected, that they form semantic fields and have relations to each other.
    For example, we see in the middle the word good, and how it is connected to the words like satisfactory, complete and clean -
    whereas a word like dirty on the lower-right is much more distant.
    Using an ontology means that we give the computer some knowledge of the world.
    For example, if confronted with the word "kidney", the computer does not understand it as the arbitrary character string "k-i-d-n-e-y",
    but situates it in a semantic network.     Additionally, we will find a definition that explains kidney as
    "either of two bean-shaped excretory organs that filter wastes from the blood".

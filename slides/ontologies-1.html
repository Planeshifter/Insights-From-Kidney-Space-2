<aside class="notes">
    For this project, we evaluated several ontologies: WordNet, which is a lexical database developed at Princeton University over the last two decades under the helm of George Miller.
    UMLS, the Unified Medical Language System is specialized for the medical domain and contains a dictionary
    which consists of more than 2 million medical and health related terms but has only a very flat ontology of 133 concepts.
    Finally, we looked at ConceptNet, which is developed at the MIT Media Lab and aggregates information from a lot of different sources, including WordNet.

<aside class="notes">
    For example, if we take the doctor synset, we know that a doctor is a health-care professional.
    We call the health-care professional a hypernym of the doctor. On the other hand, we know that the health-professional is not necessarily a doctor,
    but could also be a nurse or a physical therapist, so there are other synsets which have also health-care professional as their hypernym.
    WordNet encodes "is-A" relationships for all its synsets, ranging from the specific to the most general.

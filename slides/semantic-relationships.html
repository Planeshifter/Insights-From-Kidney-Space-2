<h2>Synset Relationships: Using WordNet’s Lexical Hierarchy</h2>
<p style="text-align:left" class="fragment">Contains hierarchy of concepts, ranging from very general ({entity}, {state}) to moderately abstract ({person, individual}) to very specific ({doctor, doc, physician}).</p>
<p style="text-align:left" class="fragment">Some terminology: For a given synset, its. . .
    <ul class="fragment">
        <li><b>hypernyms</b> are the synsets that are more general</li>
        <li><b>hyponyms</b> are the synsets that are more specific</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p style="text-align:left" class="fragment">Hyponyms have an “Is-A" relationship to their hypernyms.</p>

    However, synsets in WordNet are not isolated entities, but related to each other.
    There are a lot of semantic relations: opposites (good / bad), cause-of (heart attack -> death), part-of (a car has wheels) etc.
    We focus on the taxonomy because it is the most useful in our context.
    For example, if we take the doctor synset, we know that a doctor is a health-care professional.
    We call the health-care professional a hypernym of the doctor. On the other hand, we know that the health-professional is not necessarily a doctor,
    but could also be a nurse or a physical therapist. Logically, doctor, nurse, and physical therapists are hyponyms of the health-care professional.
    WordNet encodes such "is-A" relationships for all its synsets, ranging from the specific to the most general.

<aside class="notes">
    However, synsets in WordNet are not isolated entities, but related to each other.
    There are a lot of semantic relations: opposites (good / bad), cause-of (heart attack -> death), part-of (a car has wheels) etc.
    We focus on the taxonomy because it is the most useful in our context.
    For example, if we take the doctor synset, we know that a doctor is a health-care professional.
    We call the health-care professional a hypernym of the doctor. On the other hand, we know that the health-professional is not necessarily a doctor,
    but could also be a nurse or a physical therapist. Logically, doctor, nurse, and physical therapists are hyponyms of the health-care professional.
    WordNet encodes such "is-A" relationships for all its synsets, ranging from the specific to the most general.

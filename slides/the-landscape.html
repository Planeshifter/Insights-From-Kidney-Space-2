    The landscape I am exploring might look familiar, the healthcare sector.
    Think of hospitals, doctors etc.
    The Internet, which has emerged as a major source of health-related information, is changing this sector profoundly.
    Patients organize themselves in online self-help forums.
    Communication about medical questions which has formely faded away now leaves indelible traces.
    Looking at the blue icon which looks like a planet system,
    it represents something we were not able to scrutinize before: communication in social networks.

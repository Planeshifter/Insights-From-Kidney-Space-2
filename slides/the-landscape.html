    The landscape I am exploring might look familiar, the healthcare sector. What is the healthcare sector?
    Usually we think that it comprises hospitals, doctors etc.
    The Internet has emerged as a major source of health-related information.
    Communication about medical questions which has formely faded away now leaves indelible traces.
    Patients organize themselves in online self-help forums. Looking at the blue icon which looks like a planet system,
    it represents something we were not able to scrutinize before: communication in social networks.

    Let us have a closer look at what WordNet is. Unlike a dictionary, its basic building block is not the word,
    but the notion of a synset: a set of synonyms which represents a single concept. 
    In total, WordNet contains 117,000 of such synsets which are linked to each other by a small number of “conceptual relations.
